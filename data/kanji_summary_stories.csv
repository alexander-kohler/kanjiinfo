Story: Mr. T doesn't rely on happenstance, he makes things do what he wants. Edit: In fact three Japanese kanji dictionaries I checked all list 做 as an alternative to 作 作 (#1224), so ""make (alt)"" might be the best keyword. Story: Mr. T by happenstance found an alternative way to make things. (See also bennyb & faneca's notes).","(food for thought) I know this is RTK3 and all, but this kanji seems almost completely useless. The two most common phrases it's included in are 言い做す to speak as though something were actually the case and 見なす to regard (as equivalent). Both of which USUALLY just write なすin kana, and neither of which have anything to do with the meaning. In fact I can't find any trace of Katsuo's suggestion of this meaning. Anyone care to enlighten me? Perhaps this one's worth skipping."
